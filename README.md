## About me

![](Avatar.png)

Hello! My name is Joshua and I am a master's student in the [Barkai Lab](https://barkailab.wixsite.com/barkai) at the [Weizmann Institute of Science](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/pages/). Our lab studies how genes are regulated by a type of protein called a **transcription factor**!

Throughout my degree I have been working to strengthen my computational skills, with the ultimate goal of combining *computational* and *wet-lab* research to study how human transcription factors find their target promoters.

When I'm not in the lab, I enjoy:
- Playing soccer
- Relaxing at the beach
- Listening to music from around the world

Feel free to reach out to me by [email](mailto:joshua.bugis@weizmann.ac.il)!

## About the WIS Python Programming Course

The Weizmann Institute's Python programming course is taught by [Gábor Szabó](https://szabgab.com)

In this course we are going to learn:
- GitHub and how to use it
- Computers! How do they work and what are the main components?
- How to define and work with different data types
- Writing code to help solve a problem we face in our research (final project)!

For a full list of the topics covered in this course, check out the [course information](https://erez.weizmann.ac.il/apx/r/ws1/186/30?pid=15125&pprev=14987).
